  //checked in fire red limit is 40 chars per line, changing description length to 80/    changed to 82 max
//based on suction cups I kinda have more space?  so more like 41 per line?

//now undrestand reason strings (strings are arrays) use that +1 value
//in the elements is because C always adds an extra "null terminating character"
//to the end, its invisible to me as its automatic. but its there.
//so all limits should exclude the +1 from their calculation
//-remember all these are having +1 added to them, so sub 1 from name value to get actual value name length is 16, so max for table is 17
//like moves think need lowercase version, for those that want it.
//then just make option
